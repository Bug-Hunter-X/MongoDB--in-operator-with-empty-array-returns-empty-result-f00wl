# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall when using the `$in` operator with an empty array in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator, when used with an empty array, always returns an empty result set, which is not intuitive. This can lead to bugs in applications that expect different behavior.  This example shows the problem and a solution.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the incorrect query that uses an empty array with the `$in` operator.  This will always return an empty dataset.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a better approach. Instead of using an empty array, you should handle the case where the array is empty explicitly, perhaps using a different query method or returning a default set of results.
